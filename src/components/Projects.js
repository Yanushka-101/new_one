          <h3>Skin Cancer Detection Mobile App</h3>
          <p>

          This mobile app utilizes AI and machine learning to assist in the early detection of melanoma by allowing users to upload images of skin lesions for classification as "benign" or "malignant." Through seamless API integration, the images are processed by an advanced ML model, delivering quick and accurate results. With the critical importance of early detection in improving treatment outcomes, this app offers an accessible tool for timely diagnosis. Future updates will introduce additional classification categories to provide more comprehensive diagnosis capabilities.
